# Introduction

  This is basic OpenGL based demo application targeting Windows systems.

# Overview

This demo application was developed back in 1999 with OpenGL 1.1.

Currently I plan to eventually make it run on mobile devices by replacing the Windows specific parts by SDL and eventually making the graphics calls OpenGL ES 1.0 compliant.

OpenGL ES 2.0 is not targeted due to the effort required to drop the fixed function pipeline.


This repository is used for the work in progress.
